	<section class="prose">I sing a forlorn ballad, for a love lost- the love cost love. I want a song that I sing to be valid, in rebuking the neo love I lost my love to. I saw the old sea get caught in its rising, I see the new saw see saw mine in half, and now whenever I look toward horizon, I'm blinded reminding the past.</section>

		<h5>Declaration on Love</h5>
		Love has been declared <br/> has been instated <br/> has been codified <br/> is wrapped neatly <br/> a bow covered box (sharp white) <br/> pink and blue checker board <br/> with two or three kids in each box <br/> the to: from: names paid well to be written in stone or diamond

	<section class="prose"> The biopolitics of neo-love: love as factories of biological weapons of the state is pretty obvious, but more sinister is decimation of democratic spaces. Seeing that pink/white/blue box receding from the street, a rowhouse solitary confinement, sneaking off to work or school, making small, too small the solidarity, unity that we are preached. "I did it all for my family", held hostage by future sucess, held hostage by unknown duress. Always slipping closer moving motions grappling a top, </section>

		<h1>I Want Love</h1>
		<h2>I want insurgent love</h2>
		<h3>I want antifa love</h3>
		<h4>I want reactionary love</h4>
		<h5>Ash covered love dress sweeping down an aisle, rotting wooden pews amongst the broken tile, glass crunch blackened broken walls. Roof open to the sky, rain pooling, alter fallen celebration of a we,</h5>
		<h4>I want love that probably won't last</h4>
		<h3>I want love that refuses to make anything</h3>
		<h2>I want love that won't do anything but love</h2>
		<h1>I want love</h1>

	<section class="prose"> But how could it possibly be enforced? Neo love is a rat race, the overfishing of the many fish in the sea makes sailors and fishermen out of anyone. Neo-love is exploitation of scarcity, neo love is abject commodification, commbined with panic. All of this is of course made possibly by a generous <del>grant</del> imposition of constructing time in favor of colonialism and capitalism. (but that is a tale for another place, see: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDzl6SBCX0c">Wax or the Discovery of Television Among the Bees</a> , or <a href="http://www.drunkenboat.com/db15/micrograms-and-driven-to-abstraction"> Driven to Abstraction</a>) </section>
	<section class="poem"> time as the infinite all seeing <br/> time as it <a href="tumbles.html" target="_self"> tumbles</a> forever away from us <br/> as we forever gain ground<br/><br/> time as a left over sonnet <br/> guiding and reminding of what love wanted to be <br/> love as a battle of supremacy <br/> modeled after a system of supremacy</section>
	<section class="prose">A common theme in the use of socially internalized oppression is to cause infighting. The obvious logic is that a people who fight amongst themselves cannot organize to figtht back against the monster. This plays out in state sanctioned rooms, where thugs help to inforce whatever damages two oppressed people, once in love, seek to wreck on each other. They are being punished by each other for the break in the states codification of love. Barely anyone ever lifts a finger, most often raised voices are enough to rip open any wounds stitched by love.</section>
