stunder wonder won't stumble
trundle wubble want remember
taught december far adventure
star a trudel for a flew fell
hoeuf a loof lin staught and
new fin, newfanlged language
sought to old bandage rought
by old white men forced on all
slight stem found in a root ball
sounded like toot tall arching
from seed sprout caught by my 
mead mouth, starved from the 
need Nouns hike to the roof
then kite toward the truth 
teet, ripe for the pouncing
stalled and then nouning
appalled till we flourished
wanted by the undernourished
pining for grave sites or at
least a new brain site factored
and robbed, pushed till fight
sobbing, forced into robbing,
needed for blank mouths rubbed
wick and shrank out, bent over
posture spent by the old monster
brake broke trains faster s'over
its master, skip scooped till
plastered over reik flake scrape
sielter crumble rubbling courudl
shelter wilt house bricks all 
cast around which till subterra
ground which lo siento te ow
tick own naught te gustaba
rumble los ojos que sit still
for lobos watch creep cut and 
slaughter no sheltered brought 
off her.
