I emerge from the dirt sniffling searching the air
darting out through the tall taught tisps
whisping about high above, 
hiding the calm movement below
My fur brushes through the gentle reeds
I stop and stare upward at a new smell


My scales grip the dirt,
dragging a cool arch through the mud,
the water shimmers alongside my scales
deflected backward and forward
Our progress intertwines
I breathe the coming rain.


the dew glistens on my whiskers and grasses
they part in welcome: feeling our presence
the cat tails curtain wag with me
watching and waiting my meadow blossoms
pulsing frequencies of lives
crescendo with a joyous pounce


the herd pulses and roves, wind 
swept jangle of hooves and fur
the mass of communal motion measures
forward the horizon falls cast in golden light
branching the water flows, as we flow
across the floodplain, morphing into a landscape of life


thump thump thump, heart and wings
up up up the soul swept wind whoops
gusting rustling, the waves below, projections
of the swish sweep, feathers furled above 
voluptuous grassland stretching out oft and 
intertwined spilling seeping water, surrounded by a barren cliff


The stutter stops
Of shutters shock
Time rips life
flash framed flash bang 
A moment flees the scene.
Green grass in arrested motion
Caught in stagnated commotion
It all seeps out sludge.
Step stop river.
White flashed stream.
Caught and delivered
On a pixelated screen
As the water fades to black.
Watch old potion photos
Drink their oily water
Squeeze out hope
Leave only
Decay





we emerge from the dirt sniffling searching the air
our scales glide within the dirt,
we part in welcome: feeling our presence
the cat tails curtain wags us
gurgling pusling, the waves are projections
of the languid sweep, feathers furled
willowing about through thin cold air, 
hiding the calm movement in still warmth
our fur, gentle reeds brush
pulsing frequencies of life
dragging a cool arch through the mud,
the water shimmers alongside our scales
pulsating our meadow blossoms
new air fills our senses
dew glistens whiskers and grasses
darting through tall taught twills
the horizon cast in golden light
branching the water flows
hum hum hum the soul swept wind whuns
crescendo to a joyous pounce
the herd is a pulse of wind 
swept jangle- hooves and fur
the mass of communal motion measures
voluptuous grassland intertwined spilling 
seeping water, across the floodplain, 
dynamic landscapes of life
thump thump thump, heart and wings
our progress intertwines
we breathe the coming rain
night envelopes
as water fades to black
