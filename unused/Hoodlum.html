<p>I said:<br/> 
"fucking hoodlums" <br/>
intending: silly, small, wayward, childish, uncontrollable, in the way <br/>
I looked up <br/>
to find I was participating in the racial assault of whiteness <br/>
the sharp - read: knives, daggers, slashing cutting attack - <br/>
white background to be thrown against <br/>
no that I am throwing <br/>
that is thrown through my language <br/>
language that is the way I think <br/>
my identity <br/>
is imbued <br/>
with a hate/hierarchy/oppression/insanity <br/>
Hoodlum <br/>
all of my intentions contradict its dictionary definition <br/>
: thug <i>especially;</i> a violent criminal<br/>
because those white intentions<br/>
made it natraul to lable black youth<br/>
as violent and needing to be controlled<br/>
for <i>our</i> safety <br/>
putting black youth in more danger<br/>
for some precieved safety <br/>
of rich whites<br/>
the affective <br/>
to insure the effect<br/>
oppression subjegation control<br/>
my sheltered white life, taught to say <br/>
without considering race<br/>
only consider race in others <br/>
our colonizers language becomes a mine feild<br/>
because we don't work to diffuse it.
