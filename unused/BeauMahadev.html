<p> By rejecting recording you are rejecting the (false) ideal of permenance. Setting out a specific period of artistic creation, with both a start and a finish and eliminating the echoes created by recording. By strictly defining these ends, they are brought up for analysis, questioning the validity of striving toward permenace. This question is answered in a sense, by the heightened concentration that this setting manifests. Since the music has never been heard and will never be heard again </p>
