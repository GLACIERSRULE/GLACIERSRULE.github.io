Sorodor rips me from my mind
sifting through sand grasping at
what I hope are the controls
a wheel or a lever 
to steer me out of this desparate spiral

Occasionally something catches
a desire, thought or feeling
that I present to the tornado of my emotion
as an offering
as a way to divert the flows of self destruction
something to be consumed by the
machines creating desire in my heart
something to replicate and replace the course of my
self loathing despair
with something that fits
something that can coexist with a body of flesh and blood and sorrow and uncertainty

Because no matter how hard I try
my body will never be the ideal that I've been led to believe
is a possibility

So instead I throw a life jacket
into the storm sea-
, my errant flows of desire
and hope that something grabs onto it,
and builds a levy
to keep the waters at bay
and save my mind 
from it's destructive currents
