I visited another room
and found its sterility identical
in the way that makes you question
	 the literal meaning of identical
like, is this my room?

is this dualism
a statement?

There are artists starving,
trying to sell one painting
and this spotless bleached hell
won't let an impurity that is
expression
sully this place

I furrow clothes out of cabinets
socks across the floor
refuse to let them take away the sheets each day
now covered in food
and a dash of blood

though this room is fighting to alienate 
and isolate us
into our own stagnant bubbles
i clutch onto old towelles 
and my stained sheets
that me into the other and the one
