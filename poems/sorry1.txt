Each so on your sorry
grabs a gasp out of my throat
feels like your hand there..
but not in the fun way
only in the grabbing sucking life away.
I don't want you sorry
and I don't want them sewn together
I fear the tapestry of your sorry
and what will come out of that soon rotting quilt.
I don't think you need to be sorry
I like the way you live
I just ask that you share it a little
but sorry implies i am owed
sorry implies I somehow deserve 
somehow I am allowed to make demands
on a life that isnt mine
especially a life that is yours
fills me with the somber dread 
that a banker must feel
when He collects a loan

-please dont be sorry that I wrote this
don't say I'm sorry for prompting that
I want to share with you
without sorrow
