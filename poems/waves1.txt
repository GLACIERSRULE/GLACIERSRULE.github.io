Each new wave that crashes 
around me fills me stops me 
stills me
thrills me
Through each foggy remembered memry
I still see
sights seen in rose 
and sights seemed merose
But at each new recall
my memry stalls
stops
sputters and renews
a new old lense gets to pretend
it was there all along

It began with a fall
