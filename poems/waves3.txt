grasp lasping rasping
breaths drawn
through the raesping 
salty spray

Tranquility founnd in a sober float
glaring sunshine lighting brightening
till the dark seems impossible
until that next wave hits

I heard there was another side to this ocean
one with a beach full of love,
where the waves are present
but they don't suspend my entire being
they are there for when i go out into them
