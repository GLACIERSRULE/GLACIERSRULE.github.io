I love you like
a glowing hot coal

I once felt us raging raging dangerously
disasterously hot---
but we are through that now
which is a nostalgic smile of a different time

I feel my sides glowing hot when you blow by
I hear my heart crackle and pound
beating lighting up ever nearer
and I feel the depth of my
heat
burning closer still to a new 
flame thrown gasp of love
when the soft leaves of our desire
catch
and send sparks spiraling far and wide

I don't know about this metaphor
cause I'm not sure
If i should wish for wildfire or not

of different times:
I know we will never have a fire just like that again
but as we leap back into 
pleasant flame licked nights
I hope we can gather friends around us
and share our warmth.
