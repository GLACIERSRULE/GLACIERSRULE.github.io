my soul feels like a plastic bag
flitting through wind and water
dashing itself
crushing itself into the solid world of our separation
then filling quickly 
expanding to contain the love that blows by
the love that fills the wind and the water

a love in memory
etched by your claws into my skin
etched by your lips into mine
etched in my bones by the weight of your body and your mind
